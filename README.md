# Flappy Bird - React

A **Flappy Bird clone** built entirely with **React**.  
This project recreates the classic arcade-style game where the goal is to guide a bird through moving pipes without crashing.  

It is designed to demonstrate:
- How to use **React components** to structure a game.
- Handling animations and movement with **React hooks** and **state**.
- Managing game loops and collision detection in a browser environment.
